# Exploiting Complementary Dynamic Incoherence for DeepFake Video Detection(CDIN)

A two-branch Complementary Dynamic Interaction Network (CDIN) is proposed to exploit both global (entire face) and local (mouth region) anomalous dynamic artifacts for DeepFake detection.

This is a PyTorch implementation of the paper.
